## Introduction

The Breadchain Crowdstaking Application is a smart contract system on Gnosis Chain that accepts users' xDAI and converts it into sDAI (yield-bearing stablecoins). In exchange, stakers receive BREAD tokens minted at a 1:1 ratio with their collateralized xDAI. All interest earned on the sDAI funds the Breadchain Cooperative and its yield recipients through monthly democratic voting by BREAD holders.

This system functions as both a fundraising engine and a post-capitalist credit union, where BREAD acts as a local currency within the ecosystem while enabling transparent participatory budgeting. Token holders vote in 30-day cycles to determine how yield is distributed among yield recipients including the Crypto Commons Association, ReFi DAO, Citizen Wallet, Labor DAO, Symbiota Coop, and the Breadchain treasury.

The protocol is actively deployed at [app.breadchain.xyz](https://app.breadchain.xyz), with implementation details available on [ValueVerse](https://app.valueverse.ai/tokens/bread?tab=implementation-details). This technical specification outlines the architecture, components, and workflows that enable this solidarity primitive for democratic resource allocation.

## Background

### Context
BreadKit is an open-source economic primitive that enables any community, cooperative, or organization to deploy their own yield-bearing token system with built-in democratic governance. Rather than requiring communities to build complex DeFi infrastructure from scratch, BreadKit provides a ready-to-deploy toolkit that transforms traditional crowdfunding into a sustainable, participatory economic model.

The protocol emerged from the recognition that cooperative economics shouldn't be limited to those with deep technical expertise. By packaging yield generation, democratic distribution, and governance mechanisms into a reusable primitive, BreadKit democratizes access to post-capitalist economic tools that any group can leverage for their collective goals.

### Key Concepts

**Yield Distribution**: The protocol accumulates yield from various sources (staking, fees, etc.) and distributes it to designated yield recipients based on community voting.

**Voting Power**: Users' influence in the distribution process is determined by their token holdings over time, encouraging long-term alignment.


**Cycle-Based Operations**: The system operates in fixed-length cycles (measured in blocks), providing predictable distribution schedules while allowing for regular reallocation of resources.

### Design Principles

1. **Accessibility**: Any community can deploy and customize their own instance
2. **Decentralization**: No single entity controls yield distribution
3. **Transparency**: All votes and distributions are on-chain and auditable
4. **Flexibility**: Support for adding/removing yield recipients and adjusting parameters
5. **Incentive Alignment**: Rewards for consistent participation
6. **Upgradeability**: Protocol can evolve through governance decisions

---

## Problem Statement

Communities seeking to create their own decentralized economic systems face significant barriers:

1. **High Technical Complexity**: Building a yield-bearing token primitive requires deep smart contract expertise, making it inaccessible for most communities without specialized blockchain developers.

2. **Infrastructure Requirements**: Communities must independently develop and maintain complex infrastructure including yield generation mechanisms, distribution systems, and governance frameworks.

3. **Governance Implementation Barriers**: Implementing fair, democratic distribution mechanisms that align incentives and encourage participation requires complex voting systems and participation tracking.

The BreadKit protocol addresses these challenges by providing a reusable, community-adaptable bread primitive that enables any community to easily launch their own yield-bearing token with built-in democratic distribution and governance capabilities.

## System Architecture

The BreadKit protocol follows a modular architecture designed for flexibility, upgradeability, and composability. Each module operates independently while integrating seamlessly through well-defined interfaces.

## Core Modules

### Token Module
**Purpose**: Manages token economics and staking mechanisms

**Problem Statement**: Communities need a way to create yield-bearing tokens that represent both governance power and economic value. Traditional token systems either lack yield generation capabilities or require complex integrations with multiple DeFi protocols. Additionally, managing yield claims securely while preventing unauthorized access to accumulated yield presents significant security challenges.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BaseToken {
        <<abstract>>
        +address yieldClaimer
        +address pendingYieldClaimer
        +mint(receiver, amount)
        +burn(amount, receiver)
        +claimYield(amount, receiver)
        +setYieldClaimer(claimer)
        +yieldAccrued() returns(uint256)
        #_deposit(amount)*
        #_remit(receiver, amount)*
        #_accruedYield()*
    }
    
    class IBreadKitToken {
        <<interface>>
        +mint(receiver, amount)
        +burn(amount, receiver)
        +claimYield(amount, receiver)
        +yieldAccrued() returns(uint256)
    }

### Voting Module
**Purpose**: Handles all voting operations and power calculations with signature-based gasless voting

**Problem Statement**: Democratic resource allocation requires a fair voting system that accurately represents community member participation. Key challenges include preventing vote manipulation, ensuring votes are weighted appropriately based on token holdings, managing vote changes within cycles, enabling gasless voting through signatures, and integrating various incentive mechanisms without compromising the integrity of the voting process.

**📚 Documentation**: See [VotingModuleSignatures.md](documentation/VotingModuleSignatures.md) for detailed signature generation examples and implementation guidance.

### Cycle Management Module
**Purpose**: Manages distribution cycles and timing

**Problem Statement**: Coordinating periodic yield distributions requires precise timing mechanisms that are deterministic and resistant to manipulation. Without proper cycle management, distributions could be triggered prematurely, skipped entirely, or executed multiple times. The system must ensure predictable distribution schedules while preventing gaming of the timing mechanics.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CycleManager {
        +uint256 cycleLength
        +uint256 currentCycle
        +uint256 lastDistributionBlock
        +getCurrentCycle() returns(uint256)
        +isDistributionReady() returns(bool)
        +startNewCycle()
        +validateCycleTransition()
        +getBlocksUntilNextCycle() returns(uint256)
        -_incrementCycle()
        -_resetCycleState()
    }
    
    CycleManager --> VotingModule : checks votes
    CycleManager --> DistributionManager : triggers
```

- Distribution readiness checks
- Automated cycle resets

**Functional Requirements:**
- MUST track current cycle number and duration
- MUST determine when distributions can occur
- MUST handle cycle transitions automatically
- MUST reset voting state between cycles
- MUST maintain cycle history

**Technical Requirements:**
- Block-based timing for determinism
- Configurable cycle length
- State machine for cycle phases

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Automation
    participant CycleManager
    participant DistributionManager
    participant VotingModule

    Automation->>CycleManager: isDistributionReady()
    CycleManager->>CycleManager: Check blocks elapsed
    CycleManager->>VotingModule: Check votes cast > 0
    
    alt Cycle complete
        CycleManager-->>Automation: true
        Automation->>DistributionManager: distributeYield()
        DistributionManager->>CycleManager: startNewCycle()
        CycleManager->>CycleManager: Increment cycle number
        CycleManager->>CycleManager: Update lastDistributionBlock
        CycleManager->>VotingModule: Reset voting state
        CycleManager-->>DistributionManager: Cycle started
    else Cycle not complete
        CycleManager-->>Automation: false
    end
```

### Fixed Split Module
**Purpose**: Manages the fixed portion of yield distribution

**Problem Statement**: Many DAOs struggle to balance community-driven allocation with operational necessities. Critical infrastructure, core contributors, and essential services require predictable funding that shouldn't be subject to voting volatility. The challenge is creating a system that guarantees baseline funding for essential recipients while still allowing democratic control over the remaining resources.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FixedSplitModule {
        +uint256 fixedSplitDivisor
        +address[] fixedRecipients
        +uint256[] fixedPercentages
        +calculateFixedDistribution(totalYield) returns(uint256)
        +updateFixedSplit(divisor)
        +setFixedRecipients(recipients[], percentages[])
        +getFixedAmount(totalYield) returns(uint256)
        +distributeFixed(amount)
    }
    
    FixedSplitModule --> RecipientRegistry : gets recipients
```

**Components**:
- **Split Calculator**: Determines fixed vs voted portions

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DistributionManager
    participant FixedSplitModule
    participant Recipients

    DistributionManager->>FixedSplitModule: calculateFixedDistribution(totalYield)
    FixedSplitModule->>FixedSplitModule: fixedAmount = totalYield / fixedSplitDivisor
    
    loop For each fixed recipient
        FixedSplitModule->>FixedSplitModule: Calculate recipient share
        FixedSplitModule->>Recipients: Transfer fixed amount
    end
    
    FixedSplitModule-->>DistributionManager: Return remaining for voted distribution
```

### Recipient Registry Module
**Purpose**: Manages yield recipients and their eligibility

**Problem Statement**: Dynamic management of yield recipients poses significant challenges around security and governance. Adding or removing recipients immediately could enable attacks or hasty decisions, while overly restrictive processes could prevent necessary adaptations. The system must balance flexibility with security, ensuring recipient changes are deliberate and transparent while preventing malicious manipulation.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class RecipientRegistry {
        +address[] activeRecipients
        +address[] queuedAdditions
        +address[] queuedRemovals
        +mapping recipientMetadata
        +queueRecipientAddition(recipient)
        +queueRecipientRemoval(recipient)
        +processQueuedChanges()
        +validateRecipient(address) returns(bool)
        +getRecipientInfo(address) returns(metadata)
        -_addRecipient(address)
        -_removeRecipient(address)
    }
```

**Components**:
- **Registry Manager**: Maintains active recipient list

- Multi-signature approval options

**Functional Requirements:**
- MUST maintain list of eligible recipients
- MUST queue additions/removals for next cycle
- MUST validate recipient addresses
- MUST prevent duplicate recipients
- MUST process queued changes at cycle end

**Technical Requirements:**
- Separate queues for additions and removals
- Batch processing of changes
- Metadata storage per recipient
- Event emission for all changes

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant RecipientRegistry
    participant DistributionManager

    Note over Admin, RecipientRegistry: Queue Changes
    Admin->>RecipientRegistry: queueRecipientAddition(newRecipient)
    RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Validate not duplicate
    RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Add to queuedAdditions[]
    
    Admin->>RecipientRegistry: queueRecipientRemoval(recipient)
    RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Validate exists
    RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Add to queuedRemovals[]
    
    Note over RecipientRegistry, DistributionManager: Process at Cycle End
    DistributionManager->>RecipientRegistry: processQueuedChanges()
    
    loop For each queued addition
        RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Add to activeRecipients[]
        RecipientRegistry-->>Admin: Emit RecipientAdded
    end
    
    loop For each queued removal
        RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Remove from activeRecipients[]
        RecipientRegistry-->>Admin: Emit RecipientRemoved
    end
    
    RecipientRegistry->>RecipientRegistry: Clear queues
```


### Distribution Module
**Purpose**: Handles yield collection and allocation

**Problem Statement**: Executing fair and transparent yield distributions is complex, requiring precise calculations, secure fund transfers, and protection against various attack vectors. Without proper safeguards, distributions could be manipulated through front-running, sandwich attacks, or calculation errors. The system must ensure accurate proportional distributions while maintaining gas efficiency and preventing both accidental and malicious fund loss.

**Components**:
- **Yield Collector**: Aggregates yield from staked positions
- **Distribution Engine**: Calculates and executes fund transfers
- **Split Calculator**: Manages fixed (50%) and voted (50%) allocations

**Features**:
- Automated yield harvesting from yield sources
- Proportional distribution based on votes
- Batch distribution to multiple yield recipients
- Slippage protection and safety checks
- Emergency pause mechanisms

**Workflow:**

```mermaid

    Automation->>DistributionManager: distributeYield()
    DistributionManager->>BreadKitToken: claimYield(amount, this)
    BreadKitToken-->>DistributionManager: Yield transferred
    
    DistributionManager->>FixedSplitModule: calculateFixedDistribution(totalYield)
    FixedSplitModule-->>DistributionManager: Fixed and voted amounts
    
    DistributionManager->>RecipientRegistry: getActiveRecipients()
    RecipientRegistry-->>DistributionManager: Recipient list
    
    loop For each recipient
        DistributionManager->>DistributionManager: Calculate recipient share
        DistributionManager->>Recipients: transfer(calculated_amount)
    end
    
    DistributionManager->>RecipientRegistry: processQueuedChanges()
    DistributionManager->>DistributionManager: Reset voting state
    
    DistributionManager-->>Automation: Emit YieldDistributed event
```


### Automation Module
**Purpose**: Enables autonomous protocol operations through multiple automation providers

**Problem Statement**: Decentralized protocols require reliable automation for critical operations like yield distributions, but depending on a single automation provider creates a central point of failure. Manual execution is error-prone and defeats the purpose of autonomous operation. The challenge is implementing redundant automation systems that ensure timely execution while preventing double-spending and maintaining cost efficiency across different blockchain networks.

**Components**:
- **Automation Interface**: Standard interface for automation providers
- **Powerpool Implementation**: Resolver-based automation using Powerpool network
- **Gelato Implementation**: Task-based automation using Gelato network
- **Distribution Scheduler**: Coordinates yield distributions across providers

**Features**:
- Multi-provider support for redundancy
- Gas-efficient automation checks
- Conditional execution based on cycle state
- Provider-agnostic integration
- Fallback manual execution options
- MEV protection mechanisms

**Workflow:**
